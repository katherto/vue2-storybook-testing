# vue2-storybook-testing

The purpose for this test repo is to see what Vue 2 and Storybook's "Dynamic Code Snippets" actually do. Also I wanted to see what it was like to set up a fresh project using some of my favorite tools like WindiCSS, Vue, and Storybook together.

## Project setup

```
npm ci
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for Storybook development

```
npm run storybook
```
